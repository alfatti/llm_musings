üìÇ Where the code lives
VBA Macro (Excel side)
Open your workbook.
Press Alt + F11 ‚Üí opens the VBA editor.
Insert ‚Üí Module ‚Üí paste the full VBA code I gave you.
In the constants at the very top, set:
Private Const PYTHON_EXE As String = "C:\Users\<you>\miniconda3\python.exe"
Private Const PIPELINE_SCRIPT As String = "C:\path\to\pipeline_cli.py"
Make sure those point to your actual Python and script.
Python pipeline (backend)
Your existing Python/Gemini pipeline stays as-is.
Just add a small wrapper script (pipeline_cli.py) so VBA can call it with arguments.
Save this script somewhere permanent (e.g. C:\Users\<you>\rentroll_pipeline\pipeline_cli.py).


=====================
‚öôÔ∏è What happens when you run it
Excel user inputs
User fills RAW_RENT_ROLL tab with the raw data.
Optionally fills CONCESSIONS tab.
Export step
Macro saves each of those sheets as a temporary CSV in %TEMP%.
Python call
VBA runs:
python pipeline_cli.py --rent-roll raw_rent_roll.csv --concessions concessions.csv --out output.csv
Python script does:
Call Gemini to normalize column names & extract rent roll schema.
Join concessions if provided.
Save output.csv.
Import back
VBA clears/creates a sheet RENT_ROLL_OUTPUT.
It loads output.csv into this sheet.
A PIPELINE_LOG tab is also created/updated with stdout/stderr from Python, so you can debug if anything fails.
==========================
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run the macro
Open Excel with your workbook.
Make sure RAW_RENT_ROLL (and optionally CONCESSIONS) exist.
Press Alt + F8 ‚Üí choose Run_RentRoll_Pipeline ‚Üí press Run.
Wait for it to finish.
If successful ‚Üí results appear in a new RENT_ROLL_OUTPUT sheet.
If failure ‚Üí see PIPELINE_LOG.
